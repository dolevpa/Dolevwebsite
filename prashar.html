        <h1 class="place-header">Prashar Lake, India</h1>
        <p>The lake is located at a height of 2,730 m (8,960 ft) above sea level. With deep blue waters, the lake is held sacred to the sage Prashar and he is regarded to have meditated there. Surrounded by snow-capped peaks and looking down on the fast flowing river Beas, the lake can be approached from Mandi or from Bajaura in Kullu Valley. Both routes are 49 km (30 mi). There is a round, floating island in the lake, which is a common natural phenomenon found all around the world.[citation needed] It is composed of plant matter in various stages of decomposition, and is held aloft by the oxygen in its plants' roots. The floating island moves in all directions in the lake. The floating land covers 7% of the area of the lake.
