    <h1 class="place-header">Nubra, India</h1>
    <p>Nubra is a subdivision and a tehsil in the Indian union territory of Ladakh. Its inhabited areas form a tri-armed
        valley cut by the Nubra and Shyok rivers. Its Tibetan name Ldumra means "the valley of flowers". Demands have
        been raised and BJP has hinted at creation of Nubra as a new district. Diskit, the headquarters of Nubra, is
        about 150 km north from Leh, the capital of Ladakh.

        The Shyok River meets the Nubra River (or Siachan River) to form a large valley that separates the Ladakh and
        Karakoram Ranges. The Shyok river is a tributary of the Indus river. The average altitude of the valley is more
        than 10,000 feet (3,000 m) above the sea level. The common way to access this valley is to travel over the
        Khardung La pass from Leh.

        Foreign nationals are required to get a Protected area permit to visit Nubra. Since 1 April 2017 Indian citizens
        are also required to get an Inner Line Permit to visit it.</p>
