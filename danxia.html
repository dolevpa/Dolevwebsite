    <p>The Zhangye National Geopark (simplified Chinese: 张掖国家地质公园; traditional Chinese: 張掖國家地質公園; pinyin: Zhāngyè Guójiā
        Dìzhìgōngyuán) is located in Sunan and Linze counties within the prefecture-level city of Zhangye, in Gansu,
        China. It covers an area of 322 square kilometres (124 sq mi). The site became a quasi-national geopark on April
        23, 2012 (provisional name: Zhangye Danxia Geopark). It was formally designated as "Zhangye National Geopark" by
        the Ministry of Land and Resources on June 16, 2016 after it has passed the on-site acceptance test. Known for
        its colorful rock formations, it has been voted by Chinese media outlets as one of the most beautiful landforms
        in China.</p>
